# Band Site

[Academic Project] - A fictional band's website used to show comprehension of Flexbox, SASS, BEM, responsive design, APIs, and Javascript fundamentals.

## About

This was one of my first projects which I created for my web development diploma program. I was tasked to create a responsive, multi-page site that connects to an API throughout the course of three weeks. We were handed three mockups depicting what the end result should resemble if seen in a mobile, tablet and desktop setting. I was expected to recreate these mock-ups using the skills garnered through the course so far.
